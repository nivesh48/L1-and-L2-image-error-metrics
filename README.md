# L1-and-L2-image-error-metrics
Finding L1 and L2 error metrics between two images using numpy.

What are Norms?
  1.Norms are non-negative values, for convenience consider them as length. 
  2.Norms are 0 if the vector is a zero vector
  3.Norms respect the triangle inequity.
  
This repository explains how to calculate L1 and L2 norms between two images (Think this as how much one image is dissimilar to other)

Libraries used:
  1.Numpy
  2.Matplotlib
  3.skimage
